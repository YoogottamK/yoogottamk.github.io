The theme was created from scratch. I also used bootstrap. I tried to follow best practices everywhere and ended up using almost all of jekyll’s features.Highlights  The first thing that strikes you in the homepage is the terminal emulator. It supports some commands like ls, cd, etc. I liked the idea of navigating a website like any other directory on your computer and implemented it.  Extra time was spent on the special 404 page, which lists the urls available on the website (generated using jekyll) in increasing order of edit distances, so that you can reach the page you intended to go without having to change the url.  The blog and projects pages provide a search functionality, with which you can search by title, tags and even content!
