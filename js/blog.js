const e=[{id:"/blog/managing-path",tags:["PATH","GNU/Linux"],title:"How I manage PATH",content:"i use arch btw. Now that we have established that, lets see what the PATH variable is and how it works.According to linfo,PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files (i.e., ready-to-run programs) in response to commands issued by a user. It increases both the convenience and the safety of such operating systems and is widely considered to be the single most important environmental variable.What that roughly means is that whenever you type in a command, the shell searches for that name in all the directories present in the PATH variable. The PATH variable looks something like this:$ echo $PATH/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/some/other/dir:...It is a list of directories separated by `:`. The shell searches for the executable in each directory and ends the search as soon as it finds a file with the same name. That also means that the order of directories in PATH matters.· · ·The usual methodThe “standard” way of setting the PATH, as seen in the top search result on superuser is this:$ export PATH=$PATH:/your/new/path/hereNow, this works fine when you only need to add a few directories to PATH, and you always do that in a single file at the same place. However, the most common pattern I have seen is:...export PATH=$PATH:/your/new/path/here...export PATH=$PATH:/another/new/path/here:/oh/and/a/second/too...export PATH=$PATH:/here/we/go/again...This is bad. Updating the variable to remove a directory can be time consuming, and what if you want to give preference to a directory for an executable? You’ll have to change the order in which they are added to PATH. Doing it when your PATH updates are scattered all over the place doesn’t make it easy.Even if you write all the directories in a single line, it can get a little too long to handle sometimes:export PATH=$PATH:/your/new/path/here:/another/new/path/here:/oh/and/a/second/too:/here/we/go/again:...· · ·What I doI keep all my PATH updates in a single file and source that file in ~/.profile.That file looks like this:#!/bin/bash# directories which get prependedprepend_dirs=(    &quot;$HOME/bin&quot;    &quot;$HOME/projects/some-project&quot;    &quot;$HOME/projects/another-one&quot;    ...)# directories which get appendedappend_dirs=(    &quot;$HOME/.some-dir&quot;    &quot;$HOME/.local/bin&quot;    &quot;/usr/local/android-studio/bin&quot;    &quot;$HOME/flutter/bin&quot;    &quot;$HOME/.cargo/bin&quot;    ...)# generate the stringsprepend_path=$(IFS=&quot;:&quot;; echo &quot;${prepend_dirs[*]}&quot;)append_path=$(IFS=&quot;:&quot;; echo &quot;${append_dirs[*]}&quot;)# wth is this?!export PATH=&quot;${prepend_path:+${prepend_path}:}$PATH${append_path:+:${append_path}}&quot;ExplanationI maintain two arrays: one for prepending and one for appending.I generate the string (prepend_path, append_path) which gets added to PATH. This does not pollute your IFS, since the whole command is ran in a subshell. Also, printing ${array[*]} expands to all elements separated by the first character of IFS, which currently is `:`.The last line is special. It could simply have beenexport PATH=&quot;$prepend_path:$PATH:$append_path&quot;Although, a problem might arise when either prepend_path or append_path is empty. The final PATH might end up looking like this: :/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:...:/home/user/bin:.Solution: bash array parameter expansion${parameter:+word}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If parameter is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of word is substituted.So, if either of them are empty, the corresponding `:` won’t be added. Cool!This way, you can easily add/remove directories from PATH and easily manage the order too.· · ·This file, along with various other config files can be found in my dotfiles repo.So, did you like it?
