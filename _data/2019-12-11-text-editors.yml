comparison:
  - name: Atom
    desc: It was the first modern-looking text editor I ever used.
    good:
      - Plugins
      - A lot of themes to choose from
      - Highly customizable
      - Completely open source
    bad: After using it for a few weeks, it became clear that it was a bit too heavy for my 4GB RAM laptop.
  - name: Sublime Text
    desc: Sublime Text was awesome! It was very fast and also had a lot of plugins and themes to choose from. It was highly configurable.
    good:
      - Faster
      - Plugins
      - A lot of themes to choose from
      - Highly configurable
    bad: Sublime Text is not free, new updates/features were too slow and I wanted to try out other text editors.
  - name: VS Code
    desc: It has a lot of features and the devs keep releasing new ones constantly. Good built-in git integration.
    good:
      - Plugins
      - A lot of themes to choose from
      - Highly customizable
      - Great support for many languages out of the box
      - Built-in debugger
      - Built for JS
    bad: vim üòç
  - name: vim
    desc: "It's a terminal-based text editor which came out in 1991. A graphical version also exists (gvim). It is a modal text editor and has a very steep learning curve. I remember constantly switching to other editors when I started learning it. \n\nThis whole website is proud of being written using vim. Although 'Why vim is good' requires a full post, here are a few reasons why I still use it:"
    good:
      - Highly customizable, extendible
      - Modal editing rocks! Love those operators and motions!
      - Closely integrated with the shell, so running commands on the text is easy
      - Low resource requirement, extremely fast
      - Lots of plugins
      - Available everywhere
      - Macros!
      - "Completion (w/o plugins): filename, sentence, keywords, etc"
      - IDE like support for almost any language after configuration
      - Built in debugger (since vim8.1, check <a href="https://vimhelp.org/terminal.txt.html#terminal-debug">:h terminal-debug</a>)
      - Many many more things...
    bad: I still use it üòâ
  - name: emacs
    desc: emacs is not just a text editor, it has, along with a text editor, a web browser, a file manager, a document viewer and a lot of different things. I haven't used it a lot, but am constantly trying to use it.
    good:
      - It is highly customizable, you can extend it's abilities with lisp
      - Offers features of an IDE after a little configuration
      - Lots of plugins
      - I haven't yet discovered many other things
    bad: The `Ctrl-Meta-Char` keybindings are very difficult to get used to.
